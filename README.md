# Implementation of Stack and Queue using Linked List

1- **Clone the Repository**:

Open your terminal or command prompt.

Clone the repository using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/AfnanAfzal/Implementation-of-Sack-and-Queue-using-LinkList/tree/main

cd ProjectDSA

2- **Run the Stack Implementation**:

Navigate to the directory where the stack implementation file `Stack_using_LinkList.py` is located.

Run the stack program using Python:
python Stack_using_LinkList.py

3- **Run the Queue Implementation**:

Navigate to the directory where the queue implementation file `Queue_using_LinkList.py` is located.

Run the queue program using Python:

## Purpose of the Code

This code demonstrates how to implement stacks and queues using linked lists, providing efficient and flexible data structures for various operations.

## Features -
**Stack Implementation**:
- push(): Adds an element to the top of the stack.
- pop(): Removes the top element from the stack.
- peek(): Views the top element without removing it.
- is_empty(): Checks if the stack is empty.
- display(): Shows the elements in the stack.

**Queue Implementation**:
- enqueue(): Adds an element to the end of the queue.
- dequeue(): Removes the front element from the queue.
- peek(): Views the front element without removing it.
- is_empty(): Checks if the queue is empty.
- display(): Shows the elements in the queue

## Time Complexity for Stack
- push(): O(1)
- pop(): O(1)
- peek(): O(1)
- is_empty(): O(1)
- display(): O(n)
